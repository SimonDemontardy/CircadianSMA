Welcome on this java project and fellow scripts for analysis

The subject is to recreate a generalized en ultra simplified version of the human body 
focusing on the circadian clocks using a multi agent system

The interesting part is within the java code in jade-project/src/main/java/com/monprojet/

anything else is either tests or analysis in order to build the SMA so dont look (boring)

however there is 2 FBA that has been used and still atm: FBAstockage.py and FBAconso.py. worth a shot. 

to view the SMA in a whole, there is a file called SMA_representation.pdf

Anything else have high chance to be cleared in the future. 

enjoy reading.
